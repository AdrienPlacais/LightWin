The recommended way to obtain the LightWin code is by using `git`.
Navigate to the directory where you want to store LightWin and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:AdrienPlacais/LightWin.git

It is recommended to use the last released version; avoid beta versions (eg prefer `v0.7.0` over `v0.8.0b2`).
You can switch between versions with:

.. code-block:: bash

   git checkout v0.7.0

Alternatively, you download the code as a `.zip` file from the repository's page.
However, please note that using this method requires manually downloading updates whenever changes are made to the repository.
