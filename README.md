## Example
TODO : file from TW?

## Documentation
To generate an interactive documentation, you must ensure that you have the packages `sphinx` and `sphinx_rtd_theme` (see `INSTALL.md` for packages installation).
Go to the `LightWin/docs` folder and run: `make html`.
On Windows, `make.bat html` should do the trick (untested).
